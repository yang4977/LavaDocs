## About Me

Hello! My name is Emalee Yang and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I am majoring in Technical Writing and Communications and minoring in Public Health. This project has been developed for my WRIT 4662W course. We were asked to provide a summary and reflection of a presentation from LavaCon. My goal was to earn a better understanding of Markdown. This project has allowed me to extend my digital literacy in engaging in new skills.
